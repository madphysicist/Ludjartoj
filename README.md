Ludkartoj
=========

Ludkartoj is the Esperanto word for "playing cards", which is exactly what its
purpose is. It is a lightweight extensible server for card games.

WARNING: Currently very much WIP!


Backstory
=========

I really wanted to be able to play some Rummy-related games (Rummikub and the
Ethiopian variant Conquer) with friends of mine. I started a Java version
around the time my daughter was born, but that is now lost to time. Python's
level of abstraction seems much more suitable to the extensibility I have in
mind, so here we are.


Future
======

I will eventually expand this to include turn-based board games, since there
is nothing really differentiating them from card games besides some of the
state terminology.
